            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>MAny and wonderfull Mathematicall Concluſions are performed by the <hi>Magnet</hi> or <hi>Load-ſtone;</hi> only I will give a touch at ſome few for recreation.</p>
               <p>Theſe Stons are to be had at the Iron-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but they ought to be poliſhed and made fit by a cunning Artiſt. This Stone hath his two Poles, one North, the other South, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
<pb facs="tcp:169728:17"/>to the Poles of the World; For if you take a peece of Wyre of foure or five inches long, and touch one end thereof with a Load-ſtone, and then thruſt it through a peece of Cork, putting it to ſwim in a Baſon of water, preſently you ſhall ſee one end of the Wyre wil turne ful North, and the other full South.</p>
               <p>This Receit is profitable for ſome Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who having a Sowing-needle about them that is touched with this Stone, may prick it in ſome little light peece of Wood or Cork, and place it in the water, and it will ſet out the North and South in ſtead of a compaſſe.</p>
               <p>If for recreation you take two Wyres, and put each Wyre into a Cork, touch one Wyres end with the North end of the Stone, and the other Wyres end with the South end of the Stone, and then put them both into a Baſon of water a pretty way aſunder; yet they will begin to move and ſtir, and draw neerer and neerer together, and on the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine joyne and meet: Now if upon thoſe Wyres or Corks there were placed little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Tilters on Horſe-back, they would run their courſes at one an other in the water ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prettily.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169728:17"/>
               <p>Alſo, if this Stone or Magnet be incloſed in a box of Wood, Stone, Silver, or Braſſe, yet it wil extend its operation and working in many pretty and ingenious practiſes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to behold.</p>
               <p>As for example; If you will make the forms and pourtraitures of divers things in thin Paſtboard, as Horſe-men, Foot-men, Ships, Boates, Beaſts, Birds, Flyes, Wormes, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, or the like; you may cloſely convey into them a ſhort peece of Wyre, and then place them upon a Board, Trencher, or Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; and if you will have them move or walke, then hold the Load-ſtone cloſe in your hand, under the board, and that way which you move your hand underneath, that way the Images will move and creepe on the Top.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if you place the Load-ſtone privatly to or neere the Seeling, or over a Doore, and then hold a pecce of Iron neere to it (tying a thread to the Iron) that it touch not the Stone, which will attract it, and then the Iron will ſeeme to hang in the Ayre. If you touch an Iron Ring with this Stone, it will take up a dozen or more Rings together, hanging one to the other like a Chaine. Alſo, if a Knives poynt be touched therewith, it
<pb facs="tcp:169728:18"/>will take up Needles or Wyre, and by it you may know the counterfeit or Newgate halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny as ſome call them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Weather-Glaſſe is compos'd of a quantitie of Water and Ayre Artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incloſed therein; the water being ſubject to a continual motion (either upward or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) as the weather changeth: The Glaſſes you may have ready made at the Glaſſeſhops, but be ſure to chuſe the longeſt and ſlendereſt ſhanked glaſſes, with a ſmal head, for they are beſt: You muſt alſo have another glaſſe for a Ceſtern at the bottom to receive the water; the framing of it is thus.</p>
               <figure>
                  <figDesc>a thermometer in a stand with marked one through twelve on the shaft</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p>Your Frame ſhould be about a quarter of an inch longer then the ſhank of the Glaſſe, becauſe the lower end of the ſhank ſhould almoſt reach to the bottome of the Ceſtern: Now before you put in your glaſſe, you muſt divide the ſhank into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine degrees, from 1 to 12. or more, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the rim of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern upwards, placing figures thereon: having
<pb facs="tcp:169728:19"/>thus done, turne the head of your long glaſſe downward, and with a Funnell fill it almoſt full of water; then put the Ceſtern on the bottome boord, and holding the Frame ſloping, put the ſhanke of the Glaſſe (through the hole at the head) into the Ceſtern, and then ſet it upright. Now you muſt know at what degree to ſet your water, according to the ſeaſon of the yeare, for if it be in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and very hot weather, then to ſet it at 1. or 2. degrees are beſt, if the weather be temperate, then 3. or 4. but in cold or froſt ſet it at 9. or 10. To hit theſe degrees, (if your water be not low enough) you muſt pull up your Glaſſe a very little way from the bottome of the Coſtern, and very ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put it down againe: If yet it be not at the right degree, pul it up againe, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down, (as before) till you have your deſire.</p>
               <p>But take heed, for if your water be fallen too low in the Ceſtern, then you muſt take them out, and begin your worke againe. When it is thus done, waxe or cement your Glaſſe and Ceſtern together; and then you may cover and make a Rock about your Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, with Paſtbord or the like, glewing or paſting pecces of mother of Pearle ſhells,

               <p>The quality of the water in this Glaſſe, is to aſcend by degrees with cold and to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend with heate; for in the Winter the Water will be at the top of the Glaſſe, and in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer down to the Rock. The water ought to be very cleere, and coloured by Art, both for ornament, and the plainer to diſtinguiſh it from the Glaſſe: If you would have it green, uſe Vertdigreaſe; if yellow, uſe Saffron or, Turmerick; if red, uſe Braſill or Turnſoile.</p>

                  <p>By the uncertaine motion of the water in this Glaſſe, it is a certaine ſigne of fickle and unconſtant weather; But contrary, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the water at any one degree, is a ſure token that the weather will continue at that ſtay it is then at, whether it be faire or foule, froſt or ſnow. But when the water ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riſeth or falleth, the weather will then preſently change: Alſo, the ſodaine falling of the water is a ſure token of wet weather.</p>

               <p>AS I was writing the former Receit, it put me in mind of a pretty Conceit that a Friend once related to me, which was thus. A Gentleman being in a throng in a Faire, had his Purſe pickt out of his pocket; He miſſing it was ſome what vext, but could not mend it, but ſtudied how (if he could) to be revenged: preſently he buyeth two penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of Fiſh-hookes, and cauſeth a Taylor to ſow them round about toward the upper part of his pockets, with the points of them downwards; and ſo the next day away he goes to the Faire againe amongſt the throng, throwing his Cloak on one ſhoulder, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming careleſſe of his pocket, wherein he had ſtore of money: Preſently there was a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nibling at the baite, and nimbly had his hand in his pocket: The Gentleman being wary (perceived the Fiſh had ſwallowed the hooke,) gives a jerk aſide, which cauſed the hookes to catch good hold in his hand, and then he had him ſure: Then ſaid the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb facs="tcp:169728:21"/>Fellow, what maketh thy hand in my pocket? Oh good Sir, (replyed the Pick-pocket,) pardon me, I cannot pull it out: Come, (ſaith the Gentleman ſoftly to him, becauſe no body ſhould take notice,) goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with me; So cheeke by jole they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together, with his hand faſt in the pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, (but covered with his Cloake) and to a Tavern lovingly they goe together, where the Gentleman told him of the loſſe he had ſuſtained the day before, and making of him to reſtore back his Money, he cut out his pocket, and let him goe.

               <p>HAving ſhewed the compoſitions for Stars; now I will ſhew you how to make them, which is thus: you muſt make little ſquare pieces of brown paper, which fill with your compoſition, and ſo double it downe, rolling it till you make it ſomewhat round, about the bigneſſe of a nut or bigger, according to the ſize of the Rocket, you may put in a dozen on the head of a ſmall Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, binding them round with a thread, and then draw a cotten wick thorough it, being prepared for priming.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is another way, which is thus; take a ſmall Rowler, about the bigneſſe of an Arrow, and roule a length of paper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and paſt it round, letting it dry, and then you have a hollow trunk of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, fill this with your ingredience, thruſting it hard till it be at the top; and then cut it

               <p>The priming is thus made; take oyle of Camphire, ſoking cotten wick therein, and being moiſt, roule it in fine powder duſt, and then hang it up till it be through dry; and then keep it cloſe from ayre till you uſe it, or the ſpirit of the Camphire will decay.</p>
